When teams introduce AI tools, the most common problem is "bought but not used." Selection should start from real scenarios, not following trends. Here's a practical evaluation framework.

## Three Core Dimensions

1. **Scenario Match**: Does it cover 70% of high-frequency processes?
2. **Cost Structure**: Subscription fees, migration costs, training costs.
3. **Risk Control**: Data security, output traceability, vendor stability.

## Practical Steps: Complete Selection in Two Weeks

### Week 1: Scenario Inventory

- List 5-8 high-frequency workflows (e.g., weekly reports, customer service replies, document summaries).
- Evaluate the value and pain points of each scenario.
- Select 2-3 "highest ROI" scenarios as pilots.

### Week 2: Tool Trial Run

- Establish scoring matrix: accuracy, speed, usability, integration cost.
- Run at least 3 real cases for each scenario.
- Create comparison table, decide whether to continue.

## Pilot Design: Validate on Small Scale First

Selection doesn't equal deployment. Recommend using small-scale pilots for validation:

- Pilot team limited to 5-8 people
- Pilot period 2-3 weeks, set clear KPIs
- Collect feedback weekly, adjust usage methods

## Risk Control and Exit Mechanism

Tools must have an exit plan:

- Is data export convenient?
- Does it support privatization or backup?
- Can historical content still be accessed after subscription termination?
- Has it passed compliance and security reviews?

## Cost Checklist Template

- Subscription fee (per person/month)
- Training cost (per person/hour)
- Migration cost (person-days)
- Data governance investment (person-days)

## Skill Perspective: Selection is Also a Capability

Tool selection is a "systems thinking skill." You need to judge the balance of "value/cost/risk," not be dazzled by feature lists.

I recommend writing the selection process as a brief report:

- Why choose it?
- What does it replace?
- What risks must be managed?

## Common Pitfalls

- Only watching demos, not doing real scenario testing
- Ignoring training costs, leading to implementation failure
- Not considering exit mechanisms, locked into a tool

Tools are not the goal; the goal is to reduce friction and improve output. The more rigorous the selection, the easier the subsequent use.
