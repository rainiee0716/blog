Many people think AI is "powerful but unstable." The problem isn't the model's capability, but that you haven't given it clear "work boundaries." I treat AI as a team member, using processes to constrain input and validation, making output more stable.

## Workflow Overview: Define Results Before Prompts

My basic structure is: **Goal Definition → Input Package → Role Output → Quality Validation → Review & Consolidation**.

### 1. Goal Definition: Quantify Output Standards

Write goals in a checkable format:

- Who is the output audience? (Boss/Colleagues/Clients)
- What format is needed? (Proposal, summary, checklist, table)
- What are the key metrics? (Length, accuracy, executability)

### 2. Input Package: Feed Facts to AI First

AI's biggest problem is "confidently making things up." The solution is to provide an input package first:

- Timeline, data points, meeting conclusions
- Non-negotiable constraints: such as pricing, processes, compliance terms
- Tone to use: formal/neutral/concise


### 3. Role Output: Let AI Play Different Roles

I use three fixed roles:

1. **Researcher**: Organize facts and background, output key points list.
2. **Drafter**: Generate initial draft according to structure.
3. **Checker**: Use checklist to verify logic, facts, and tone item by item.

Each role's prompt is short but fixed, making it a "skill script."

### 4. Quality Validation: Use Checklists, Not Feelings

My checklist has three fixed questions:

- Are any key facts missing?
- Are there conclusions without supporting evidence?
- Can it be executed directly? If not, what step is missing?

Put the checklist in the prompt, let AI self-check before review.

## Real Case: A Requirements Review Summary

I needed to summarize a 1-hour review meeting. My process was:

1. Input package: Meeting notes, key decisions, risk points, responsible persons.
2. Researcher output: List three groups of points: "Goal-Conclusion-Risk."
3. Drafter output: Generate summary in "Background/Conclusion/To-Do" structure.
4. Checker review: Require item-by-item comparison with meeting notes, mark uncertain content.

The final summary quality improved significantly.

## Build Your Own Skill List

Turn common scenarios into a skill list, such as:

- Weekly report output
- Proposal summary
- Competitor comparison
- Meeting notes organization

Each scenario has a fixed prompt template, gradually forming your "AI skill map."

## Common Pitfalls

- Directly asking AI to generate without providing factual input
- Not setting success criteria, making output unevaluable
- Using only one prompt without role division

When you put AI into a process, it becomes as stable as a reliable collaborator.
