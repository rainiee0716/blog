AI can improve efficiency, but what truly determines your career height are "uniquely human higher-order capabilities." I break down career moats into three categories and provide actionable training paths.

## Three Irreplaceable Capabilities

### 1. Structured Problem-Solving Ability

Breaking complex problems into verifiable hypotheses and action paths is something no tool can easily replace. It determines whether you can grasp the real key points.

### 2. Decision-Making and Influence

AI can provide suggestions, but "making choices under uncertainty and making people believe" remains the core value of managers.

### 3. Reflection and Iteration Ability

Whether you can turn failures into model updates determines long-term growth speed. AI can assist in recording, but the reflection framework must be led by you.

## Practical Path: Build Your Skill Stack

I recommend using the "skill stack" method, breaking capabilities into trainable modules:

1. **Problem Structuring**: Do 1 problem decomposition exercise per week.
2. **Decision Expression**: Practice giving clear decision rationale in 3 sentences.
3. **Reflection Model**: Write a 1-page reflection card after each project.

## 90-Day Moat Plan

- Days 1-30: Pick a real problem for structured decomposition, produce model notes.
- Days 31-60: Take on a key decision, write the rationale as external communication.
- Days 61-90: Do a deep reflection, extract a reusable improvement checklist.

The goal of this rhythm is to turn "capability" into "replicable process," not one-time performance.

## A Real Example

After a project delay, I used this framework for reflection:

- Structuring: Delay was caused by requirement changes + unstable dependencies.
- Decision: Chose to do MVP first, optimize after launch.
- Reflection: Summarized collaboration rhythm issues, established "dependency early warning mechanism."

This process helped me form a stable handling pattern, rather than relying on improvisation each time.

## Three Things You Can Do Right Now

1. List your current skill inventory, mark "irreplaceable" capabilities.
2. Hold weekly reflection meetings, use AI to generate records, but you output conclusions.
3. Update your career moat map monthly, identify new gaps.

AI will make low-level work faster, but higher-order capabilities remain key to determining career ceiling. Treat skill training as a long-term investment, and you'll go further than most.
