In this world full of uncertainty, we often rely on "analogical thinking": doing what others do with slight improvements, or following market trends. While this approach is safe, it also limits the possibilities for innovation.

**First Principles** offers a completely different perspective. Popularized in the tech world by Elon Musk, this concept actually originates from the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

## What are First Principles?

Simply put, first principles means **stripping things down to their most basic truths (Facts), and then reasoning up from there**.

The opposite is **Reasoning by Analogy**. Analogical thinking understands things by asking "what is it like?" For example: "We want to build a better search engine" usually means making minor adjustments to existing search engines.

First principles thinking asks: "What is the essence of a search engine? What is the fundamental human need for information retrieval? Besides the current search box format, are there other ways to satisfy this need?"

## Three Steps of First Principles

### 1. Identify and Question Your Current Assumptions

When facing problems, we subconsciously have many preconceptions.
*   "Battery packs are really expensive, they have to be."
*   "Opening a restaurant must be in a high-traffic area."
*   "Software development requires a large sales team."

The first step is to list all these "taken-for-granted" assumptions and question them: Is this a law of physics? Or is it just a current habit?

### 2. Break Down the Problem into Basic Facts

Break down the problem until it can't be broken down further. At this level, only physical laws, mathematical axioms, or basic human needs remain.

Musk's classic thinking when building rockets was like this:
> "Everyone says battery packs are too expensive, about $600/kWh. But this is not an unchangeable fact.
> What are batteries made of? Carbon, nickel, aluminum, polymers... If we buy these raw materials on the London Metal Exchange and combine them, how much would it cost? Only $80/kWh."

Through this breakdown, he discovered that batteries are expensive not because materials are expensive, but because of inefficiencies in the supply chain and manufacturing process. This directly led to Tesla's redevelopment of battery technology.

### 3. Reconstruct Solutions from Scratch

When you have a bunch of "basic building blocks," you can freely rebuild solutions without being constrained by old forms.

This is like the difference between a **Chef** and a **Cook**:
*   A **Cook** follows recipes. Even with slight modifications, they can't escape the recipe's framework (analogical thinking).
*   A **Chef** understands the taste and chemical reactions of each ingredient and can directly create a completely new dish (first principles).

## How to Practice First Principles?

First principles sounds cool, but it's difficult to practice. Because it requires us to fight against the brain's "effort-saving" instinct. Here are two tools that can help:

### Socratic Questioning

Revealing truth through a series of rigorous questions:
1.  **Clarify this idea**: I might be wrong, what am I really trying to express?
2.  **Challenge assumptions**: Why do I think this way? Does this assumption always hold?
3.  **Seek evidence**: What evidence supports this view? What about counter-evidence?
4.  **Consider alternatives**: If I don't do it this way, what else can I do?
5.  **Derive consequences**: If I'm wrong, what are the consequences?

### "5 Whys"

Keep asking "why" like a child on this issue until you find the root cause.
*   Q: Why did the machine stop?
*   A: Because the overload fuse blew.
*   Q: Why was it overloaded?
*   A: Because the bearing wasn't lubricated enough, causing excessive friction.
*   Q: Why wasn't it lubricated enough?
*   A: Because the lubrication pump couldn't draw oil.
*   Q: ...

## Conclusion

First principles is not just a business strategy, but a life philosophy. It teaches us not to follow just because "everyone does it this way," and not to blindly follow "tradition."

Only when you clear away the fog of appearances and see things as they truly are can you master true creativity.
