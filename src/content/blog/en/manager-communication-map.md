When you first become a manager, the biggest challenge is often not doing the work, but "making the work visible." Without proper communication, you'll fall into a state of "I'm very busy, but the organization doesn't feel it." This article gives you a communication map to help you systematically align information.

## Three-Layer Information Alignment Method

Communication should be layered, with higher layers being fewer but more critical:

1. **Goal Layer**: Direction and success criteria (most important for superiors).
2. **Process Layer**: Action rhythm and coordination (most important for peers).
3. **Risk Layer**: Uncertainties and response plans (important for everyone).

Put every communication in this framework, and you won't "talk about a bunch of details but nobody gets the point."

## Practical Steps: Complete Alignment with Three Rhythms

### 1. Goal Layer: Once a week, 15 minutes

- Have goals changed?
- Do you need resources or decisions?
- Which metric best proves value?

### 2. Process Layer: Async updates every two days

- What step are we currently at?
- Do you need collaboration from others?
- Are there any milestone changes?

### 3. Risk Layer: Triggered before key milestones

- What are the risk points?
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- What alternative plans have I prepared?

Risk alerts should "have options," not just "report bad news."

## A Real Scenario

You're responsible for a cross-team new project. You should communicate like this:

1. Goal Layer: Confirm with your boss that the goal is "delivery experience-focused," not "on-time launch."
2. Process Layer: Sync development rhythm every two days to avoid resource misallocation.
3. Risk Layer: Inform dependent parties in advance of potential impacts from delays, and provide alternative plans.

The result: Others can see your value and are more willing to support you.

## Skill Perspective: Communication is Not Talent, It's a Skill

Communication skills can be quantitatively trained. I recommend creating a "communication skill record card":

- How many times did I align on the goal layer this week?
- Did I provide clear risk warnings?
- Did I offer alternative options?

You'll find yourself gradually upgrading from "execution-type communication" to "strategic communication."

## Common Pitfalls

- Only reporting progress, not impact.
- Dragging risks to the last minute.
- Only communicating upward, ignoring horizontal partners.

The essence of a communication map is building trust and visibility. As long as you can stably align the three layers of information, you can significantly enhance your influence within the organization.
