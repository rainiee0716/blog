Many OKR retrospectives eventually turn into "completion reports" but offer no clear guidance for the next quarter. I recommend using a structured retrospective to realign goals, strategies, and resources.

## Four-Dimensional Retrospective Framework

The retrospective is divided into four dimensions, each answering a key question:

1. **Results**: How were the goals achieved? Where were the deviations?
2. **Strategy**: Which approaches worked? Which wasted resources?
3. **Resources**: Did manpower, budget, and dependencies match?
4. **Growth**: What changes occurred in team capabilities and collaboration?

## Preparation: Establish the Facts First

A retrospective without a factual basis can easily turn into an emotional summary. It is recommended to complete three things before the review:

- Collect data, key decision records, and user feedback.
- Interview 1-2 collaborators to identify real blockers.
- Use AI to generate a timeline, but manually verify key milestones.

## Practical Steps: Complete the Review in 90 Minutes

### 1. Results Layer: Present the Data First

- Metric achievement rate.
- Whether key milestones were delayed.
- Whether user/customer feedback met expectations.

### 2. Strategy Layer: Deconstruct Key Actions

- Which strategy contributed the most?
- Were there actions that were "busy but unproductive"?
- Was any strategy proven ineffective?

### 3. Resource Layer: Identify Bottlenecks

- Was manpower insufficient?
- Were external dependencies stable?
- Did collaboration processes slow down the pace?

### 4. Growth Layer: Refine Capability Changes

- Did the team master new tools or processes?
- What improvements were made in individual capabilities?
- Which skills still need to be supplemented?

## Retrospective Template Example

- Objective: Increase conversion rate to 8%.
- Result: 7.1%; the deviation was caused by changes in the traffic structure.
- Strategy: Optimizing the funnel path was effective, but advertising performance was weak.
- Resources: Insufficient support for data analysis.
- Growth: The team improved A/B testing capabilities but lacked growth modeling skills.
- Next Step: Solve the data capability issue first, then invest in advertising.

## Output Checklist: Ensure Actionability

I suggest outputting 3 things for each retrospective:

1. **Continue doing**: 2-3 strategies with significant effects.
2. **Stop doing**: 1-2 inefficient actions.
3. **Focus on filling**: 1 key capability or skill gap.

A retrospective is not a summary; it is the action map for the next quarter. By aligning results, strategy, resources, and growth one by one, OKRs truly become a driving force.
