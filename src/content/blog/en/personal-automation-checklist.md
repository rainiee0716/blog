AI solves "generating content," while automation solves "reducing friction." True efficiency comes from system processes, not one-time high performance. Below is my long-term maintained personal automation checklist.

## 12 High-Frequency Processes

- Automatic organization of meeting minutes
- Weekly report generation and sending
- Requirement collection and archiving
- Document version reminders
- Automatic update of metric reports
- Task status synchronization
- Competitor information monitoring
- Categorization of customer feedback
- Automatic filling of email templates
- Kanban data cleaning
- Archiving of retrospective records
- Work order distribution and reminders

## Practical Steps: Building the System from 0 to 1

1. Pick the 3 most time-consuming processes first.
2. Break down the process into "Trigger → Processing → Output."
3. Define clear input and output formats for each step to avoid the process spinning out of control.
4. Start with semi-automation, then gradually automate further.

## Tool Selection Advice

- Use automation platforms for lightweight scenarios (e.g., forms + notifications).
- Use scripts or API integration for heavy scenarios.
- Critical processes must support logging and rollbacks.

## Risk Control Checklist

- Is there a manual review step?
- Is there a downgrade plan in case of failure?
- Are error reasons recorded?

## Automation Checklist Template

I record each process using the following template:

- Trigger Condition:
- Key Inputs:
- Output Format:
- Exception Handling:
- Review Method:

## The Skill Perspective: Process Design is a Capability

Automation is not a technical show-off, but a "process design skill." You need to constantly ask yourself:

- Which step is the most error-prone?
- Which step wastes the most time?
- Which step can be handed over to tools?

## Monthly Retrospective: Letting Automation Continuously Evolve

Spend 30 minutes every month on a retrospective:

- Which automation process is the most effective?
- Which process has too high a maintenance cost?
- Have any new high-frequency pain points emerged?

Record these questions in your "automation backlog" and prioritize the highest-value processes next month.

## Common Pitfalls

- Going fully automated directly, ignoring reviews.
- Automation scope is too large, leading to high failure costs.
- Failure to document the process, leading to subsequent unmaintainability.

When you turn automation into a system, you will find that time and energy are released to make higher-value decisions.
