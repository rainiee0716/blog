If a weekly report is not written well, it’s often not because you don’t know how to write it, but because the information is too scattered. A truly efficient weekly report is "facts first, views converged, actions clear." I use a 30-minute process to make AI an assistant for organizing and polishing while ensuring the content is traceable.

## The 30-Minute Deconstruction Method

I break the weekly report into three 10-minute modules:

1. **Fact Collection** (10 minutes): List this week's data, decisions, and key events.
2. **Structured Output** (10 minutes): Fill in the blanks according to a fixed template and let AI assist in organizing.
3. **Value Verification** (10 minutes): Check whether it has decision-making value for your boss.

## Fixed Template: Reduce Repeated Revisions

The template structure is as follows (recommended to be used consistently every week):

- This Week’s Achievements (3-5 items, preferably quantified)
- Problems and Risks (Scope of impact + handling plan)
- Next Week’s Plan (Clear deliverables + time points)

AI is only responsible for converting the fact list into easy-to-read expressions; it cannot replace you in providing facts.

## AI Prompt Example

> You are my weekly report editor. Output a three-part weekly report based on the "Fact List": Achievements, Risks, and Plans. Each item should not exceed 2 lines, be expressed from a business perspective, and avoid exaggeration. If information is insufficient, please mark it as "to be supplemented."

This prompt will force the AI to expose information gaps and avoid "making up stories."

## Practical Steps: From List to Weekly Report

1. Create a "Fact List" page in Notion or Feishu.
2. Collect daily: data, meeting decisions, key collaborations, and customer feedback.
3. Copy the list to AI on Friday and generate the first draft using the template.
4. Perform your own "value verification," changing the expressions to have judgmental value for the business.

## The Skill Perspective: Treating Weekly Reports as an Expression Skill

A weekly report is actually a "reporting skill." You can make a simple skill score sheet:

- Are the facts complete? (1-5 points)
- Is the impact clear? (1-5 points)
- Are the actions executable? (1-5 points)

Rate yourself every week; after 3 weeks, you will feel a significant improvement in your expression.

## Common Pitfalls

- Only writing the process, not the results.
- Only mentioning problems, not giving options.
- Plans being too vague, with no deliverables.

The value of a weekly report is to "assist in decision-making," not to "prove you are busy." By using templates + AI for consistent output, you will build professional credibility faster.
